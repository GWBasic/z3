To make your own basic template, please put it in the "custom" folder.

Don't edit the templates in "built-in," as that will cause problems getting
updates.

It is suggested that you start by copying one of templates in the built-in
folder. Your template must set css color variables that the rest of z3's css
use; and your template must specify a background image.

Select this template on /config.

To make more advanced changes, such as to provide your own css or html, see
the instructions on /config.
